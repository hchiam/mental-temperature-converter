This project is a boilerplate to help get you started building your own [Actions on Google](https://developers.google.com/actions/) for the Google Assistant that work with API.ai. This code will act as the [webhook fulfillment](https://docs.api.ai/docs/webhook) endpoint. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live. Click the Show button to see your live endpoint URL.

Glitch is a developer playground that lets you code a real web-app without the slow setup and deployment steps. You can use Glitch to build an API backend that fulfills webhook requests from API.ai by providing a response for the Assistant to read to the user.

[About Glitch](https://glitch.com/about)

## Your Project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env`

On the front-end,
- edit `client.js`, `style.css` and `index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
